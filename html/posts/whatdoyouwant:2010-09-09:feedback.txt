What Do You Want?

<p>Really, I want to know.  Head on over to the <a href="http://galaxyharvester.net/feedback.py">feedback page</a> and submit a suggestion for the site, or vote on ones already there.  A few suggestions that we have gotten from people by email so far have already been added.  If you have a suggestion, it might be a good idea to browse or search the ones already there to see if someone else already had the same idea.</p>

<p>We want to use this not only as a way to find out what you want to see on the site, but also as a guide to what most people are most interested in.  That way we know what features to work on first.  But that will only work if you cast your votes!</p>
