Favorites Enhancements

<p>A few updates are being released today, mainly related to the <a href="http://galaxyharvester.net/myResources.py">favorites/my resources tool</a>.  These are the three main enhancements there you can enjoy now:</p>

<ul>
<li>My Resources list sortable by clicking on a column header</li>
<li>Export button for saving your resources list as a .csv file</li>
<li>View list of your favorite resource types, with links to those types. (Being able to favorite a resource type is new as well.  To favorite a resource type, just click the star next to the name on that resource type's page.)</li>
</ul>

<p>There's also some other minor release notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix for occasional login issues related to small differences in the way a user name is typed.</li>
<li>Fix for some instances where a user could not access their own recipes.</li>
<li>Display recent spawns above top spawns on resource type page.</li>
<li>Added a back to recipe home page to the individual recipe detail screen.</li>
<li>Added a link from favorites/my resources to the recipe home page.</li>
