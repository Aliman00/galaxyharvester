Update: The Bestiary And More

<p>I sometimes find myself searching old websites trying to find which creatures drop a certain type of hide, meat, or bone.  Now we can get the information right here on Galaxy Harvester.  Click on a resource type link to go to it's page and you will now find a list of creatures that that resource type can be harvested from.  Here is an example <a href="/resourceType.py/meat_carnivore_dathomir" title="Dathomir Carnivore Meat page">Dathomir Carnivore Meat</a>.</p>
<br />
<p>A few other updates are listed here:</p>
<ul class="plain">
<li>Resource Group ID is now included in the xml and csv export files.</li>
<li>You can now do a quick search by resource type from the home page.</li>
<li>Other basic resource type information such as Min/Max stats have been added to the Resource Type pages</li>
</ul>
