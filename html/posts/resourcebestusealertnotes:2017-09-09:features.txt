Resource Best Use and Alert Filter Groups

<p>Decided to pick off the top two items on the <a href="http://galaxyharvester.net/feedback/py">Suggestions</a> page today.  Here are the features involved:</p>

<p>The first feature is all about checking what a resource might currently be good for.  The way this has been implemented is a button on each
 individual resource page labeled "Check Current Best Uses".  When you click this button Galaxy Harvester will go out and essentially redo the
 lookups for server best resource, then replace the currently displayed list of server best events that triggered when the resource spawned with
 a new list showing what schematics it currently scores well on.  The criteria is a little more lax when running this operation compared with
 the initial spawn server best checks, to show more possibilities.</p>

<p>Second up is a new field on the <a href="http://galaxyharvester.net/myAlerts.py">My Alert Filters</a> screen where you can now add a group name
 or note to each filter.  You might use this area to group together similar filters by profession or some other general grouping (the rows will
 sort by it), or just a general note to help remind you what you set the alert for.</p>
